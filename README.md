Supplementary code for the **"Bile acids promote Enterobacteriaceae colonization by invoking gut mitochondrial dysfunction in Crohnâ€™s disease patients"** submission.
The relevant R-markdown notebooks for each figure:    

**Figure 1F**: ANCOM-based differential expression analysis used to create the figure 1F is in the `16S_res` folder at `redoing DA analysis.rmd`.  

**Figure 3A-D**: Code is in the `TC-7 Proteomics` folder.
* `proteomics analysis.rmd` contains the starter code for data import and normalization/analysis.
* `proteomics_viz.rmd` contains the code for final analysis and visualizations.
  
**Figure 5D**: Code is in the `HMP2_study` folder. 
* `transcript_entero_cor.rmd` contains code for doing association analysis between Enterobacteriaceae and individual protein transcripts of interest. This was ultimately not used in the paper.
* `trancript_summary_entero_cor.rmd` contains code for the association analysis between Enterobacteriaceae and protein groups. This code was used to create Figure 5D.

**Table S6**: Code is in the `TC-7 Proteomics` folder.
